FOR MID TERM EVALUATION - 

Problem - Preposition disambiguation. 
Dataset- Web reviews 
 
Prepare models. 
show results on initial models and keep transfer learning for later.

also keep evaluation on sem eval corpus for later. 

MODELS - 

Pass the context through 2 LSTMs, concatenate it with the vector of preposition and predict the class.
Above has 2 variants - pre trained vectors or not.

We can show class wise accuracies.

Random assignment using class wise weighted probabilities over all prepositions.
Random assignment for each preposition using class wise weighted probabilities.

For each preposition, assign the max prob. weight class directly.

Assign the maximum weighted class to all prepositions.

Feed forward network, instead of an LSTM. (again with pre trained and without pre trained.)

Keep transfer learning and other analysis for later.

Ensemble methods keep for later.
